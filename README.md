Simple letter tiles for minetest.

Mod dependencies: none other than dyes from the minetest_game 

Crafting
========

Blank tiles are required to craft tiles with letters. Ten can be
crafted with one white dye placed directly below one clay lump
anywhere on the grid.

The recipies for the letters are based on the Braille alphabet. The
two left hand columns of the crafting grid represent the Braille
six dot cell, dark green dye is used for the dots and the other
slots are empty. The upper two slots of the right hand grid are
left empty and blank tiles go in the bottom right slot.

Examples:

D = dark green dye
B = blank tile
_ = empty slot

A:
    D _ _
    _ _ _
    _ _ B

Q:
    D D _
    D D _
    D _ B

V:
    D _ _
    D _ _
    D D B
